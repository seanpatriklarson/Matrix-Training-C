Description of the program:
In this project we utilize matrix operations in C to allow the program to learn from a set of training data. After training the program, it is able to predict house prices based on
a few parameters such as the year it was built, the size of the house, and current price of the house. This is a primitive form of machine learning. The data is stored in a matrix
of the size of the input file, and populates an array with all of the data found in train.txt. Then, we find the transpose of the training matrix, then the square of the transpose
training matrix. After, we use the inverse of the square training matrix and transposed training matrix to obtain a matrix which is a the product of the two. Finally, we take a
vector with the houseprices from train.txt and the aforementioned product matrix to get the weight vector. It's now done, the program has been trained to predict house prices from
a few parameters. We multiply the weight vector with a matrix containing the data from data.txt, and print out a vector containing the house prices for all of those houses (parameters minus houseprices).
